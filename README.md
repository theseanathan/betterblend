Collaborative playlists are great for parties, but the issue is that when anyone can add to it, 
there’s no means to reject/accept a song addition. This results in a messy playlist with various 
songs that don’t necessarily align with the entire party. Perfect Party Playlist will allow people 
to add to a playlist, but first be put into a queue in which other participants of the party can 
vote to be added to the playlist. Voting will be limited to once per song, but as many songs as 
you want in the queue. Every x minutes, the highest voted song in the queue will be added to the 
playlist for the party.
